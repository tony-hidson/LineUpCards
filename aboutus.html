        <h2>About Official Gear.</h2>
        <p> Official Gear was founded by Tony Hidson, a referee and coach who spent years on the court with tools that didn’t quite do the job. After enough frustrating moments and workarounds, he decided to build what he wished he had — durable, functional, and thoughtfully designed equipment that actually met the demands of the game.
        </p>
        <p>
          What began with a simple net-measuring tool has grown into a trusted source for quality gear used by referees, coaches, and sports organizations across the country. From the innovative Tactical Clipboard to essential officiating accessories, every product is designed from firsthand experience, tested in real settings, and built to last.
            At Official Gear, we believe in making products that serve the people behind the whistle and on the sidelines — the ones who keep sport moving. No fluff, no gimmicks, just gear that works as hard as you do.
